response for prompt: tell me about compiler in two sentences 
 *****

A compiler is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language, which is more human-readable, into a low-level machine language that a computer can understand and execute. This process allows programmers to write code in a more convenient way and the computer to understand and run it efficiently.
