Please provide me with the context or the information you did not understand. I need more information to help you. 

For example, you could tell me:

 What were you trying to understand?  (e.g., "I didn't understand the explanation of the concept of quantum entanglement.")
 What was the source of the information you didn't understand? (e.g., "I was reading an article about artificial intelligence, but I didn't understand this part about machine learning.") 
 What specifically confused you? (e.g., "I didn't understand the phrase 'deep learning' in that article.")

The more details you provide, the better I can help you understand.
