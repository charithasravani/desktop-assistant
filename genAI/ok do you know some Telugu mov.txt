I do! Telugu cinema has a rich history and produces a wide variety of movies. To give you a better idea of what kind of films you're interested in, could you tell me:

 What kind of genres do you like? (Action, comedy, romance, drama, thriller, etc.)
 Are there any specific themes you're interested in? (Social issues, historical epics, fantasy, etc.)
 Are you looking for recent releases or older classics?
 Are you familiar with any Telugu actors or directors?

Once I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can recommend some great Telugu movies for you.
