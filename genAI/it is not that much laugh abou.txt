Please provide me with more context. I need to understand what you're referring to in order to be able to help you. 

For example, you could tell me:

* **What you found not funny:** "I don't find that joke about [topic] very funny."
* **The situation:** "I don't think it's appropriate to laugh about [situation] right now."
* **Who said it:** "I don't think it's funny that [person] said [statement]." 

Once I have more information, I can understand your request and respond appropriately.
