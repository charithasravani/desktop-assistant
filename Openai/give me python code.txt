Gemini AI response for Query: using artificial intelligence give me python code
*************************

Please provide me with more information about what you want the Python code to do! 

To give you the best possible code, I need to know:

 What problem are you trying to solve?  What is the goal of the code?
 What input data will the code use? What format is it in? 
 What output should the code produce?  What format should it be in?
 What specific AI tasks are involved? Are you using machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, etc.?
 Are there any libraries you'd like to use? 

For example, you could ask me to:

 "Write Python code to classify images of cats and dogs using a pre-trained TensorFlow model."
 "Create a Python program that uses a GPT-3 API to generate creative text based on user input."
 "Build a Python chatbot that can answer questions about a specific topic using a knowledge graph."

The more details you provide, the better I can understand your request and give you accurate and helpful code.
